# 💎 Algorithms and Data Structures in Ruby 💎

Hello! This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structures implemented in Ruby, accompanied by tests conducted with RSpec.

## 🎯 Objectives 🎯

This project has several purposes:

- 🚀 Improve my programming skills in Ruby.
- 🧪 Practice and enhance my knowledge in testing with RSpec.
- 📚 Create a quick reference resource for recalling how certain algorithms and data structures work.
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Share with the community implementations and solutions in Ruby that might be useful to others.

## 📂 Repository Structure 📂

The repository is organized into two main folders:

1. 📁 `algorithms`: Here you will find various classic algorithms implemented in Ruby.
2. 📁 `data_structures`: In this folder, you will find different data structures implemented in Ruby.

Each algorithm and data structure has a corresponding RSpec test file.

## ⚙️ How to use this repository ⚙️

To use this repository, simply clone the repository on your local machine and browse through the files.

To run the tests with RSpec, make sure you have RSpec installed (`gem install rspec`) and then run `rspec` at the root directory.

## 🙌 Contributions 🙌

All contributions are welcome! If you have any implementation of an algorithm or data structure in Ruby that you would like to share, feel free to make a Pull Request.
